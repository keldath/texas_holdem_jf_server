    # texas_holdem_jf_v2
 
    Second version of the texas holdem
    poker hand based on treys library and combinations

    left deck and draw as custom code by me
    
    key note:
    the fast api maintains a state. this is just for the sake of the exersize.
    in real life, the data should be stored per session on a data base or as such.
    the reason for not saving the result of api's in the client is cause 
    saving data about the hands there isnt very secured...:)
